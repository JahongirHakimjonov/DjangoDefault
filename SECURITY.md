# Security Policy

## Introduction

This document outlines the security processes and policies for the Django Default project. Our goal is to keep the project as secure as possible and to deal promptly with any security issues that arise.

## Supported Versions

The following versions of Django Default are currently being supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Django Default, please report it to us as soon as possible. Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Please send your report to: jahongirhakimjonov@gmail.com

Include the following information with your report:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability

We take all security reports seriously and will respond swiftly to fix verifiable security issues. We ask that you follow responsible disclosure, not disclosing the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.

## Security Update Policy

Once a security issue is reported, we will assess the impact and develop a fix. Security updates will be released as part of our regular update cycle or as an immediate patch, depending on the severity of the issue.

We will notify users of security updates through:

- [Project's Update Mechanism]
- [Mailing List, Blog, etc.]
